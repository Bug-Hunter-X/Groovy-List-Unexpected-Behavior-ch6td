This repository demonstrates a common source of confusion for new Groovy developers: the behavior of the Groovy `List`.  Groovy's `List` is backed by a `java.util.ArrayList`, which means it inherits methods that aren't always intuitive from a purely Groovy perspective.  Specifically, this example shows the difference between using the `<<` operator and the `add()` method to add elements to the list, highlighting the unexpected similarity in outcome which can lead to debugging difficulties.
