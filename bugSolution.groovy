Understanding the underlying Java implementation is key.  While both `<<` and `add()` append elements to the end of the list in this case, relying solely on `<<` promotes more idiomatic Groovy code.  The example showcases that there is a difference; `add()` is a method from the underlying java.util.ArrayList. Using the more idiomatic `<<` operator enhances readability and maintainability. If you need to use specific ArrayList methods, you may need to cast the list explicitly.  Consider consistency in your approach to avoid unexpected behavior.
